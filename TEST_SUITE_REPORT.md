  - Phone numbers and emails
  - Weather data
  - Vector embeddings
  - Timestamps and dates

### 2. Test Infrastructure
- **TestSetup.js**: Database initialization and cleanup

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Vector Operations**: Missing `insertWithVector` function in database layer
2. **Rate Limiting**: No geographic filtering implementation
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Missing implementation in connection pool
4. **Input Validation**: XSS vulnerabilities in form inputs
5. **Memory Leaks**: Large result sets not properly cleaned

### Performance Baselines Established
- Simple SELECT: < 10ms average
- Indexed SELECT: < 15ms average  
- JOIN queries: < 50ms average
- Vector similarity search: < 100ms average
- Bulk insert (1000 records): < 1 second
- Concurrent operations: 95%+ success rate
