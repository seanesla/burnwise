### ⏳ PENDING TESTS (71/105) - 67.6%
Remaining 71 tests not yet executed due to blocking issues

## Critical Findings

### 1. GAUSSIAN PLUME MODEL BROKEN
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Core smoke dispersion calculations return NaN
```javascript
Emission rate: NaN g/s
Dispersion at 1km: σy = NaN m, σz = NaN m
Concentration: NaN µg/m³
```
**Impact:** Cannot predict smoke dispersion, EPA compliance impossible

### 2. AGENT INITIALIZATION FAILURES
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** All 5 agents report status "not active"
```
Coordinator: not active
Weather: not active  
Predictor: not active
Optimizer: not active
Alerts: not active
```
**Impact:** 5-agent system non-functional

### 3. API ENDPOINT FAILURES
**Severity:** HIGH
```
POST /api/burn-requests: 400 Bad Request
GET /api/farms (proximity): 500 Internal Server Error
GET /api/schedule/:date: Database error
GET /api/alerts/history/:id: 404 Not Found
```
**Impact:** Core functionality unavailable

### 4. DATABASE CIRCUIT BREAKER
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Connection pool circuit breaker opens after 5 failures
**Impact:** Database becomes unavailable after errors accumulate

### 5. MISSING INTEGRATIONS
**Severity:** MEDIUM
- Twilio credentials missing (SMS won't work)
- Weather forecast API returns 401
- Socket.io real-time updates untested
- Mapbox partially working (token fixed but features untested)

## Violations of README.md Requirements

### Core Features Not Working:
1. **5-Agent Workflow** - Agents not properly initialized
2. **Gaussian Plume Model** - Mathematical calculations broken
3. **Smoke Dispersion Prediction** - Returns NaN values
4. **Schedule Optimization** - Database errors prevent access
5. **Real-time Updates** - Socket.io integration untested
6. **Alert System** - API endpoints return 404
7. **Conflict Detection** - Cannot test without working predictions
8. **EPA Compliance** - PM2.5 calculations non-functional

### Data Requirements Not Met:
- ❌ Weather embeddings not stored as 128-dim vectors
- ❌ Historical pattern matching not implemented
- ❌ Simulated annealing optimization inaccessible
- ❌ Audit trail for approvals not verified

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Vector Search | <1000ms | 62ms | ✅ PASS |
| API Response | <500ms | Unknown | ⚠️ |
| Connection Pool | 10 concurrent | Fails at 5 | ❌ FAIL |
| Rate Limiting | 100/15min | Untested | ⚠️ |
| Query Timeout | 10s | Untested | ⚠️ |

## Security Assessment

**NOT TESTED** - Critical security tests pending:
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- API authentication
- Sensitive data logging
- Authorization checks

## Accessibility Compliance

**NOT TESTED** - WCAG AA compliance unknown:
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast
- Focus indicators

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:
1. **Fix Gaussian plume NaN calculations** - Core feature broken
2. **Initialize all agents properly** - System non-functional
3. **Fix database circuit breaker** - Causes cascading failures
4. **Repair API endpoints** - Multiple 400/404/500 errors
5. **Add missing Twilio credentials** - SMS alerts won't work

### BEFORE PRODUCTION:
1. Complete all 105 tests
2. Fix all mathematical calculations
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add security measures
5. Test accessibility standards
6. Verify EPA compliance calculations
7. Load test with realistic data
8. Document all API endpoints

## Conclusion

**Application Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY**

Only **10.5% of requirements** are verified working. Critical features like smoke dispersion prediction, 5-agent coordination, and schedule optimization are broken or untested.

The application requires significant debugging and development before it can safely coordinate agricultural burns as described in README.md.

**Risk Level: EXTREME** - Deploying in current state could result in:
- Dangerous smoke overlaps
- EPA violations
- Public health hazards
- Legal liability
