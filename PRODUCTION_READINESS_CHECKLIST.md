   ./rotate-credentials.sh
   # Update all external services with new keys
   ```

2. [ ] **Clean Git History**
   ```bash
   ./clean-git-history.sh
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

3. [ ] **Update Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.new backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.new frontend/.env
   # Add actual API keys
   ```

4. [ ] **Final Security Check**
   ```bash
   cd backend && node test-security.js
   ```

### During Deployment
