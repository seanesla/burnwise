# üö® URGENT ACTION ITEMS FOR HACKATHON SUBMISSION

## üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Submission)

### 1. Create Missing Documentation Files
```bash
# Run these commands:
touch SETUP.md
touch API_KEYS_REQUIRED.md  
touch FOR_JUDGES.md
touch FUNCTIONALITY.md
```

**SETUP.md** should contain:
- Step-by-step installation guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Common issues and solutions

**API_KEYS_REQUIRED.md** should contain:
- List of required API keys
- How to obtain each key
- Where to place them in .env files

**FOR_JUDGES.md** should contain:
- Quick start guide for judges
- Key features to test
- Demo credentials
- Expected outcomes

### 2. Fix API Endpoint Discrepancies

Add to `backend/api/burnRequests.js`:
```javascript
// Add conflict detection endpoint
router.post('/detect-conflicts', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Move conflict detection logic here
}));
```

Add to `backend/api/alerts.js`:
```javascript
// Add send alert endpoint  
router.post('/send', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Alert sending logic
}));
```

### 3. Clean Up Test Files
Remove profanity from these files:
- `backend/tests/deep-tests/real-fucking-test.js` ‚Üí rename to `real-integration-test.js`
- Search for any other inappropriate language

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Strongly Recommended)

### 1. Prepare Demo Video Script
```
0:00-0:30 - Problem statement with visuals
0:30-1:00 - Show 5-agent architecture diagram
1:00-2:30 - Live demo: Submit burn request
2:30-3:30 - Show vector search in action
3:30-4:30 - Demonstrate conflict resolution
4:30-5:00 - Results and impact
```

### 2. Add API Documentation
Create `backend/api-docs.json` with OpenAPI/Swagger spec

### 3. Test Full Workflow
```bash
npm run seed
npm run dev
# Test complete burn request flow
# Verify all 5 agents execute
# Check vector operations
```

## üü¢ NICE TO HAVE (If Time Permits)

1. Implement Bull queue for job processing
2. Add more vector search examples
3. Improve mobile responsiveness
4. Add loading animations
5. Create architecture video

## üìã SUBMISSION CHECKLIST

- [ ] All documentation files created
- [ ] API endpoints match README
- [ ] Test files cleaned up
- [ ] Full workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Demo video recorded (5 min max)
- [ ] GitHub repository public
- [ ] TiDB Cloud account email noted
- [ ] Submission form filled

## üéØ KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE

1. **"5 coordinated AI agents"** - More than required
2. **"Real Gaussian plume model"** - Scientific accuracy
3. **"3 types of vectors"** - Deep TiDB integration
4. **"100+ tests"** - Production ready
5. **"Prevents highway accidents"** - Social impact

## ‚è∞ TIME ESTIMATE

- Critical fixes: 2-3 hours
- High priority: 3-4 hours  
- Demo video: 2 hours
- Total: ~8 hours to submission-ready

## üí™ YOU'VE GOT THIS!

Your project is already in the **TOP TIER**. These fixes will push it into **WINNING TERRITORY**.

Focus on:
1. Documentation files (easy win)
2. API endpoint fixes (quick)
3. Killer demo video (crucial)

The technical implementation is EXCELLENT. Just need to polish the presentation!
